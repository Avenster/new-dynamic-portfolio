# Getting Started with Create React App
# Dynamic Portfolio Generator for Artists

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Overview

## Available Scripts
The Dynamic Portfolio Generator is an innovative web application designed to help artists create digital portfolios based on their unique style and preferred themes. This project combines the power of AI-generated art with user preferences to produce personalized digital art portfolios.

In the project directory, you can run:
**Live Demo:** [http://51.20.55.249:3000/](http://51.20.55.249:3000/)

### `npm start`
## Features

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- **User Authentication:** Secure signup and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Style Input:** Artists can describe their preferred style and themes.
- **AI-Generated Art:** Utilizes the Pixlr API to generate art pieces based on user descriptions.
- **Dynamic Portfolio View:** Users can view their generated portfolios in real-time.
- **Responsive Design:** A user-friendly interface that works across various devices.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
## Technology Stack

### `npm test`
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **API Integration:** Pixlr API for image generation
- **Deployment:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
## Setup and Installation

### `npm run build`
### Prerequisites

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- MongoDB account

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
### Local Development Setup

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-portfolio-generator.git
   cd dynamic-portfolio-generator
   ```

### `npm run eject`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   PIXLR_API_KEY=your_pixlr_api_key
   ```

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
## Deployment

## Learn More
The application is deployed on AWS. Here's an overview of the deployment process:

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
1. **EC2 Instance:** The application is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
2. **Domain and SSL:** We use a custom domain with SSL certification for secure access.

### Code Splitting
3. **Environment Setup:** Node.js and npm are installed on the EC2 instance.

This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting)
4. **Application Deployment:**
   - Clone the repository on the EC2 instance.
   - Install dependencies using `npm install`.
   - Set up environment variables in a `.env` file.
   - Use PM2 or a similar process manager to keep the application running.

### Analyzing the Bundle Size
5. **Nginx Configuration:** Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests.

This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size)
6. **SSL Certificate:** Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certification.

### Making a Progressive Web App
7. **MongoDB Atlas:** The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas for improved scalability and management.

## API Endpoints

### Advanced Configuration
- `POST /signup`: Register a new user
- `POST /login`: Authenticate a user and receive a JWT
- `GET /protected`: A protected route example (requires authentication)
- `GET /fetch-images`: Fetch AI-generated images based on user input

## Security Measures

### Deployment
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing in the database.
- JWTs are used for maintaining secure sessions.
- CORS is configured to accept requests only from the frontend origin.

## Future Enhancements

### `npm run build` fails to minify
- Implement social login (Google, GitHub)
- Add more customization options for portfolio generation
- Introduce a gallery feature for users to showcase their best-generated works
